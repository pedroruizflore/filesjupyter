    "Data analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "First Idea -> Have the average user ratings of video games changed over time?\n",
    "\n",
    "The average user rating of video games has been on a slow, slight decline over the past 10-15 years, possibly due to increased competition and saturation in the market. A dataset of video games that includes the Release Year and a User Score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use pandas to load and clean the dataset, focusing only on the Release Year and Rating; Group the data by Release Year and use NumPy functions to calculate the average rating for games released in that year; \n",
    "Create a Line Plot showing the trend of the average rating over the years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second Idea -> Is there a correlation between the day of the year and the daily temperature range?\n",
    "\n",
    "Daily temperature range is higher during the summer months than in the winter months, due to factors like less cloud cover and lower air moisture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Source: Simple, publicly available historical daily weather data for a single city.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use pandas to calculate a new column for the Temperature Range (High and Low).\n",
    "Group the data by Month to find the average range for each month.\n",
    "Create a simple Line Plot showing the average temperature range for each month of the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Program 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Type: Standalone Utility (User input -> specific output)\n",
    "Concept: A program that focuses on a single category of conversion: Mass and Weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "User Input: Prompt the user to enter a numerical value and the starting unit (e.g., kilograms, pounds, grams).\n",
    " Conversion Logic: Write simple functions to convert the input to a few target units (e.g., convert kilograms to pounds, ounces, and grams).\n",
    "Output: Clearly display the results in a formatted string.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Program 2: (I think there's a way to make it better but I haven't thought about how) \n",
    "\n",
    "Type: Game-Style (Continuous Input)\n",
    "Concept: A classic \"higher or lower\" guessing game, designed to practice simple continuous user input and basic game loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generation: Use the random library to generate a secret number between a defined range (for example, 1 to 100).\n",
    "Game Loop: The core loop continuously asks the user for a guess.\n",
    "The program provides immediate feedback: \"Too high,\" \"Too low,\" or \"You got it!\" This is your continuous input and response.\n",
    "Score: Track the number of attempts and display it when the user wins."
