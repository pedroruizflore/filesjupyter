    "Data analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "First Idea -> Have the average user ratings of video games changed over time?\n",
    "\n",
    "The average user rating of video games has been on a slow, slight decline over the past 10-15 years, \n",
    "possibly due to increased competition and saturation in the market. A dataset of video games that includes \n",
    "the Release Year and a User Score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use pandas to load and clean the dataset, focusing only on the Release Year and Rating; \n",
    "Group the data by Release Year and use NumPy functions to calculate the average rating for games released in that year; \n",
    "Create a Line Plot showing the trend of the average rating over the years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second Idea -> Is there a correlation between the day of the year and the daily temperature range?\n",
    "\n",
    "I will investigate the correlation between daily cloud cover and the daily temperature range across all seasons. \n",
    "My expanded hypothesis is that increased average cloud cover on a given day is correlated with a \n",
    "smaller daily temperature range (clouds act as an insulator, keeping nights warmer and days cooler).\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Source: Publicly available historical daily weather data for a single city. The dataset must now include: \n",
    "Date, High Temp, Low Temp, and a measure of Cloud Cover or Precipitation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use pandas to calculate a new column for the Temperature Range (High and Low).\n",
    "Group the data by Month to find the average range for each month.\n",
    "Create a simple Line Plot showing the average temperature range for each month of the year.\n",
    "\n",

    "Program 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Type: Standalone Program \n",
    "Concept: A program that not only generates a random maze on a grid but then uses a simple algorithm \n",
    "to automatically find and display the solution path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid Representation: Use a NumPy 2D array to represent the maze grid. Each cell is an integer (0 for a path, 1 for a wall).\n",
    "\n",
    "Maze Generation: Implement a basic algorithm to randomly carve paths through the grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualization: Use a library like Pygame to visually draw the maze.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solver Algorithm: Implement a simple pathfinding algorithm that takes the start and end points of the NumPy array and returns the sequence of coordinates for the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: Display the maze, then draw the calculated solution path over the maze. Pandas is not strictly needed here but NumPy is essential for grid manipulation and linear algebra (if you wanted to get fancy with movement vectors).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Program 2: \n",
    "\n",
    "Type: Game-Style (Continuous Input/Text-Based)\n",
    "Concept: A simplified, text-based Role-Playing Game (RPG) focusing solely on inventory and resource management—think \n",
    "a basic merchant or dungeon explorer. The user interacts by typing commands (buy sword, check inventory, use potion).\n",
    "\n",
    "Inventory System: Use a Python dictionary or list of dictionaries to represent the inventory. This is your core data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource Management Loop: A continuous loop that displays the player's current gold and inventory, then prompts for a command.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shops: Use a basic CSV file read by pandas to store all available items (Name, Cost, Weight, Effect). The program reads this data at startup.\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy Application: Use NumPy arrays to manage a simple, fixed set of character attributes (Health, Stamina, Damage Bonus) which are modified by items in the inventory."
